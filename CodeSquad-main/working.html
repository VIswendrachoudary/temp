        <h1>Budget Buddy</h1>
        <p>Our free budget calculator will help you to know exactly where your money is being spent, and how much you’ve got coming in. Knowing how to manage a budget – keep track of where every rupee is being spent – is a great first step to starting your savings. Our free Budget Planner can help.</p>
        
        <p>College life is often a period where students must balance academic responsibilities with newfound financial independence. For many, this marks the first time they are responsible for managing their own finances, including rent, utilities, food, and entertainment. Given these challenges, the need for a practical budgeting tool tailored to the unique needs of students becomes clear. Imagine a web page that not only helps students track their spending but also suggests nearby restaurants and shops that fit within their financial constraints. Such a web page would offer a user-friendly experience, integrating budgeting tools with personalized, location-based recommendations to ensure students can live affordably without sacrificing their lifestyle.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Components of the Web Page</h2>
        <p>This web page would function as a comprehensive budgeting platform for students. Its primary goal is to help students efficiently manage their income and expenses while discovering affordable dining and shopping options within their local area. The key components include:</p>
        
        <h2>Budget Manager</h2>
        <p>At the core of this platform is the Budget Manager. Here, students would input their monthly income, which could come from various sources such as part-time jobs, scholarships, or allowances. The Budget Manager would prompt students to categorize their expenses, allowing them to allocate funds for essential categories like:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Housing and Utilities</li>
            <li>Entertainment</li>
            <li>Groceries</li>
            <li>Transportation</li>
        </ul>
